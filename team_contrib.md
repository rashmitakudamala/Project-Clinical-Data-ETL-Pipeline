## Team Members and Roles

| Team Member           | Role                              | Key Contributions                                                                                                                   | Reflection                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Poojitha Surgi**    | ETL & Coding Lead                 | Ran and refined most of the Python scripts for Tasks 1-4 and set up the data files used across the pipeline.                        | “Working through the ETL steps in code helped me better connect the FHIR resources, SNOMED concepts, and server responses instead of seeing them as separate pieces.”                                                           |
| **Rashmita Kudamala** | Data Testing & Content Support    | Helped debug the Observation and Procedure tasks, checked JSON outputs, and contributed ideas and notes for the ETL documentation and insights. | “I realized how sensitive the APIs are to small mistakes in codes and fields. Testing the JSON step by step helped me understand the structure of Observation and Procedure resources much better.” |
| **Chaitra Sammeta**   | HL7 & Website / Documentation Lead| Worked on the HL7 `ADT_A01` script, created the architecture diagram, and organized the GitHub Pages site layout and formatting.    | “Connecting the FHIR JSON to an HL7 v2 message and then explaining it on the website helped me see how technical standards and clear communication have to go together.”                            |

## Summary of Collaboration

All three of us worked together on **every part of the project**.  
We met regularly to walk through each coding task, review each other’s scripts, and check that the FHIR resources and HL7 message looked reasonable.  
We also shared ideas for the **website content**, where one person usually drafted text, another suggested changes or examples, and another focused on formatting and layout.
